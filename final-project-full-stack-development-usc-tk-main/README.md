# CSC301-2023-FinalProject
CSC301 2023 Final Project - Full-stack development

## Task description: Front-end
You have been asked to develop a trivia web application with the following components:
- A home page that allows the participant to enter a name. The name is **required** to start the trivia
- The trivia page needs to display each question (one at a time) and their options. The participant needs to select an answer before proceeding to the next question. This page must have a timer that will start as soon as the trivia page is loaded and will stop as soon as the last question has been answered
- The final page needs to display the name of the participant, their score and the total time. Additionally, this page shows the top 5 participants who have the most questions answered correctly in the shortest time. You have to show the name, their score and the total time

## Task description: Back-end
In addition to the front-end developed previously now your task is to implement an appropriate back-end with the following components:
- Every trivia question and their options must be stored in the database
- Every time a trivia is finished, the results along with the total time and the participant must be stored in the database

### Required technologies
- You **must** develop this web application using CSS, React.JS, Express.JS and MongoDB. If you want to use more libraries feel free to include them
- You **must** use a CSS framework (e.g., bootstrap, tailwind, etc.)
- The application needs to be deployed to Microsoft Azure. You can create a free account and have up to 10 web applications for free
- In Canvas please submit a document with a link to your GitHub repository and a link to your deployed application
